Many assimilated and formed their own communities with subtle influences of the past blended into this new western world. Others left and traveled into the plains and forests exploring and living on as they had for thousands of years.</p>

He claimed a god appeared to him and the sight was so great that it burned the eyes right out of his head. But the god spoke to him and said it was a worthy price to pay for the gift he would receive. The god said he was the lord of gods, the creator of everything and nothing, and that the humans were his champions, and should they worship him he would ensure them a place in paradise in the afterlife. Some thought this man crazy, but this concept that the creator god had championed humans of all races, a race without religion up to this point, caught on like wildfire. It empowered humans and drove them to achieve great things. They called this god, Elos.</p>
